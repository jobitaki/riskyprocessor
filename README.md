My attempt at a barebones RISC-V core (RISCV32I). This is still a work in progress. I am creating this core as an educational challenge.

### Progress:

- [x] 5 stage pipeline
- [x] Load/store instructions
- [ ] Little endian loading
- [X] Arithmetic instructions
- [x] Data forwarding
- [ ] Load-store forwarding
- [X] Jump instructions
- [X] Branch instructions
- [ ] Branch prediction
- [ ] Verification
